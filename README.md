# Secret-Coding-Language
A project has been created in a unique coding language where the user enters three words. If the length of the combined words is greater than three, the language will append the first 3 characters at the beginning and end, and attach the first character to the end of the word. If the length of the combined words is less than or equal to three, the words will be reversed.
